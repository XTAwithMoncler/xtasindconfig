This changes the boot animation and eject LED's to match a XTA moddifed console.

The boot LED is set to RED.
The iND background is set to BLACK.
If you use this file you will need to set your own dashboard paths!
the 128MB folder contains a verison of the config optimized for 128MB consoles, It is the exact same as the original config with 1 simple flag changed.
This config should be download and copy if you used hexen to TSOP flash your console (aka no modification needed if you TSOPed your console using hexen and are running evoX or UnleashX!
